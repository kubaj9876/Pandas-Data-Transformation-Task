# Pandas-Data-Transformation-Task

Implementation focuses on strict input validation and vectorized pandas operations for performance

Key Features
  * Strict Validation: Only letters and underscores are allowed in labels.
  * Vectorized Operations: Uses Pandas built-in methods (`add`, `sub`, `mul`).
  * Error Handling: Returns an empty DataFrame for invalid inputs.
